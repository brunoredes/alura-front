>## About the project
The project is called "Barbearia Alura", where a website was developed, using HTML and CSS technologies. In this project, for not approaching CSS3 with the use of FlexBox and Grid Layout, Inline display and Inline block were used (although I have placed grid and flexbox). Also covered in this project were: Use of tags, semantics for each case, internal and external spacing, text alignment, positions, borders, pseudo classes and pseudo CSS elements, CSS hierarchy, css selectors with ">", "~", " +", External sources, calculations with css, shadows and media queries.
